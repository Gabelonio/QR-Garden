# QR - Garden
#### Gabriel Esteban Castillo 
### Introduction
This short project generates QR code images based on three types of information, blocks, areas and cutters.
Those Categories were based on an application project in the need of creating a visual reference to 
organize their production area.

### General information
Each type has different characteristics, beginning with the block information, it has:

1. Number. Example : 3.
2. Area. Example : D.
3. Variety. Example : RO04.

Each Cutter has the next information:

1. Name(s). Example : Sebastian.
2. Family Name(s). Example : Ramirez.
3. ID. Example : 10304813.

And each Area has the next information:

1. Type. Example : Gerbera.
3. ID. Example : 1241556.

### Interactions
In this section we are going to explain the different interactions the user is able to do in this software,
these are going to be essentially the same, although, it is important to know different keys in each interaction.

#### Generating a Block
Generating a block is the less complex of the options, as the information is filled only with combo boxes,
each area has different numbers and each number different varieties as well.

#### Generating a Cutter
Generating a cutter will request first and family name(s), the user can only type letters and spaces. The 
ID will allow an ID of 8 characters long, also, only numbers are allowed in this space.

#### Generating an Area
Generating an area request two spaces, an ID, which receives a number of maximum 8 characters long and a type, 
which receives an option, these options are shown in the image.

### Software structure
The software uses Java for every component.

#### Visualization and its interaction 
The interface shown previously uses the Java libraries Java.awt and Javax.swing.

Java.awt is used in this project for:
* Color configuration.
* Fonts used.
* Action listeners.
* Action events.

Javax.swing is used in this project for:
* Combo boxes usage.
* Buttons usage.
* Frames usage.
* Labels usage.
* Texts inputs.

The main menu has options to execute the different actions mentioned in the interactions available.

#### Functionality
Every action mentioned have their own logical components in classes, which are their setters and
getters, these classes are:
* Bloque.java.
* Cortador.java.
* Malla.java.

In addition, all are located in the "clasesCultivo" package.
Other classes represent the software's graphical user interface:
* CreadorBloque.java.
* CreadorCortador.java.
* CreadorMalla.java.
* MenuPrincipal.java.

Other classes which also represent significant processes in the project are these:
* Main.java.
* CreadorCodigo.java.

Main.java deploys the application creating an instance of "MenuPrincipal.java".
CreadorCodigo.java creates all the QR Codes in this software, this uses the following
packages to execute that action:
* java.awt. 
* java.io.
* java.util.
* javax.swing.
* javax.imageio.
* com.google.zxing.

Each function has a description (input and output if it is necessary) inside the project
which can be opened with Eclipse or with a text editor for each .java document.

The last two sources (7 and 8) were referenced libraries for the project's correct working.

Reference 3, 7 and 8 are property of the MVN Repository.

Reference 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are property of Oracle.

### Execution
By cloning this repository, the user will only has to double click the "QR Garden" jar file and the software will deploy.
The Sources folder saves in .png files the latest images generated by the software, also contains the referenced libraries, which, as I mentioned, are property of the MVN Repository. For that reason, DO NOT REMOVE that folder.
